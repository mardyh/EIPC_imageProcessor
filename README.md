# EIPC_imageProcessor
Small tool to process images for photogrammetry, focusing on masking for now

To build the model needs to be in the same folder as the .py file. Download the model from https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg in the "Models" section.
I have built the tool with the u2net model in mind.
